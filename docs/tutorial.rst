Tutorial for MD in CP2k
**************************

This tutorial will help you in setting up input files for CP2k to run classical molecular dynamics simulations. 
There are some tedious steps that need to be done in order to run such simulations, especially if you do not have a .pdb file available and need to make your own. This tutorial will make several assumptions (e.g. you already have a force-field available for your system), however it will certainly help you in preparing your input files quickly.
Because my field of research is in colloidal nanocrystals, then the set-up proposed here is mostly for those type of systems. However, the scripts are generally applicable to other type of systems as well. 

Pre-requirements

* Force-field parameters

It is required that you already have
